//! Implements the Unifying Receiver.
//!
//! Unifying is a versatile receiver that can pair up to 6 devices using the
//! 2.4 GHz eQuad radio protocol. It uses HID++ 1.0 registers for receiver
//! control; paired devices speak HID++ 2.0 once addressed via their slot index.
//!
//! The register layout for device enumeration (`0xB5/0x5N`, `0xB5/0x6N`) is
//! identical to Bolt's. The device-kind encoding differs from Bolt at values 5+
//! (see [`DeviceKind`]).
